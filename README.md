## 🧭 About Me

I'm a backend-focused software engineer with a passion for building systems that make life easier and more efficient at scale.

Currently enrolled in the **ALX Pro Backend Development** program, I’m focused on deepening my backend engineering skills while solving real-world problems through tech.

💡 I’m driven by the goal of helping products and platforms **positively impact at least 10,000 people per year**, especially those that serve overlooked or underserved use cases—regardless of location or demographic.

Whether it's AI-powered tools, cooperative finance systems, productivity apps, or entirely new spaces, I’m excited about building **scalable, maintainable, and meaningful software**.
